# VirtualPetSloth

I created a virtual pet "Snuggles the Sloth"

Snugles is introduced with base hunger, thirst, poop, and tired levels.
The virtual pet askes to feed, give water, takeout, or laydown as options to meet the sloths needs

I created a tick method in which a generator randomly populates a number that is added to the baseline values
the values also have parameters in which the player is notified when that pet is hungry, thirsty, needs to go out, or is tired

I also included a method is which it falls asleep on its own and where it poops itself if not taken out...

ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
